## Stack:
Telescope is written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the
[actix](https://actix.rs/) framework and the [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
templating engine. We also use [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for CSS and 
a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API as the backend. 

## Goals
This Fall, my goals for Telescope are to bring it to the RCOS membership as the 
main way to interact with RCOS information. This involves finishing the last 
few minimum features and publishing version 1.0.0.
