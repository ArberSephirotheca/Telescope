# The Telescope Config format is a serialized version
# of the structures in src/env.rs.
#
# For anyone using or developing telescope, this configuration template should
# be copied to config.toml and then modified to your needs.
#
# This file only contains 3 profiles (development, prodcution)
# but users may specify more arbirarilty using the profile objects.
# Profiles may override any/all of the global settings.
#
# Each required config option must be specified somewhere, either top-level
# or in some level of the active profile (which is specified using commandline arguments).
#
# Any option specified at top level and in a profile (or subprofile) is resolved
# as the specification with the most depth. when `telescope=trace` is active in
# the log level options then the options active at runtime are logged on server
# start up.
#

# [REQUIRED]
# specify the log level of the telescope server instance
# see https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.8.1/env_logger/ for syntax and options.

# [REQUIRED]
# Specify the location to bind the running server.
# HTTP traffic will be rediected to HTTPS.
# These default ports work with Docker but may need to be changed to work
# outside of docker.
bind_https = "localhost:443"
bind_http  = "localhost:80"

# [REQUIRED]
# Specify the URL of the RCOS central API. This default value is okay for
# testing locally in docker but should probably be changed in production.
api_url = "http://hasura:8080/v1/graphql"

# [REQUIRED]
# The JSON web token (jwt) key used to encode JWTs when authenticating with
# the central RCOS API. This shcould match the one in the .env file.
jwt_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# [REQUIRED]
# The TLS/SSL configurations. These are specified as the paths of the
# TLS/SSL credentials generated earlier in the setup (see the readme), or
# in production environments isssued by a certificate authority.
[tls_config]
# [REQUIRED]
# The TLS/SSL certification file.
cert_file = "tls-ssl/certificate.pem"
# [REQUIRED]
# The TLS/SSL private key chain file.
private_key_file = "tls-ssl/private-key.pem"

# [REQUIRED]
# The GitHub OAuth application credentials.
# These can be generated at https://github.com/settings/applications/new.
# Make sure the redirect URL matches the homepage URL followed by
# "/auth/github".
[github_credentials]
# [REQUIRED]
# The GitHub OAuth application client id.
client_id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
# [REQUIRED]
# The GitHub OAuth application client secret.

# [REQUIRED]
# These settings specify what to do with emails generated by the server.
[email_config]
# [OPTIONAL]
# The name used to sign emails sent by the server.
name = "RCOS Telescope"
# [REQUIRED]
# The email address that emails are sent from.
address = "telescope@rcos.io"
# [REQUIRED]
# Should the emails generated by the server be printed to the terminal in
# a log message? Very useful for development, but probably undesireable for
# production environments.
stub = true
# [OPTIONAL]
# specify a path to save generated emails in text files.
file = "/tmp"
# [OPTIONAL]
# Send the emails to users from an email account using SMTP.
[email_config.smtp]
# [REQUIRED]
# The SMTP server.
host = "smtp.rcos.io"
# [REQUIRED]
# The port of the SMTP server to connect to as a client.

# email address before the @ symbol.

# Development Profile
# These options will override the global ones when telescope is run using
# `telescope -p dev`
[profile.dev]
log_level = "info,telescope=trace"

# Sysadmin development subprofile.
# This uses all the options specified in the dev profile and
# also overrides the sysadmin config.
# Use `telescope -p dev.create_sysadmin`
[profile.dev.profile.create_sysadmin.sysadmin_config]
